# Image Super-Resolution for Satellite Imagery

This project contains different deep learning models for image super-resolution applied to satellite imagery. The models are organized into subdirectories and will be connected into a single pipeline.

## Project Structure

- `Super-Resolution Model/`: Contains the super-resolution model and its associated files.
- `Denoising Model/`: Contains the deep learning model for denoising and its associated files.

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python -m venv Super-Resolution Model/venv
    ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
        ```sh
        Super-Resolution Model\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On macOS/Linux:
        ```sh
        source Super-Resolution Model/venv/bin/activate
        ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
